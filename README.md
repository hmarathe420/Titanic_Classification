# Titanic_Classification
As a Data Science Intern at Bharat Intern, I am thrilled to be working on the "Titanic Survival Classification" project. In collaboration with the esteemed team at Bharat Intern, I have been entrusted with the task of developing a robust classification model to predict the survival outcomes of passengers aboard the historic RMS Titanic.
